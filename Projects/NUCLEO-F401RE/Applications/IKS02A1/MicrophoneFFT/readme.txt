@par Example Description

Main function is to show how to perform acquisition of the on-board 
digital MEMS microphones, PDM to PCM decimation, FFT processing and 
streaming of the result toward a host PC.

A digital MEMS microphone can be acquired by using different peripherals, 
such as SPI, I2S, SAI, GPIO or DFSDM. It requires an input clock and it outputs a PDM 
stream at the same frequency of the input clock. This PDM stream is further filtered 
and decimated in order to be converted in PCM format, that is the main standard 
for audio transmission; this application is based on I2S or SAI acquisition and in any 
case DMA is used to transfer data from acquisition peripherals to internal SRAM. 

Using BSP layer and Middlewares functionalities, all the required peripherals and 
libraries are configured (PDM to PCM library, FFT library), basing on the desired sampling 
frequency to be achieved, which is, in this case, equal to 48 KHz. 

After acquisition and PDM to PCM conversion, a complete spectral analysis is performed,
based on the following steps:
  - Windowing
  - Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
  - Normalization
  - Averaging

Two tasks of different priorities are created exploiting sw-generated interrupts allowing to
continue microphone acquisition seamlessly, even when high amount of processing power is 
needed for the algorithms.

To run the application, it is needed to install and launch the Unicleo-GUI on the PC.
The Unicleo-GUI is available on https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/sensor-software-development-tools/unicleo-gui.html

@par How to use it ? 

This package contains projects for 3 IDEs: IAR, Keil ÂµVision and STM32CubeIDE. In order to make the 
program work, you must do the following:
  - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
    installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
    after building.
  - Open STM32CubeIDE or alternatively the Keil uVision toolchain or the IAR toolchain.
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
  - Run the example.
  - Alternatively, you can download the pre-built binaries in "Binary" 
    folder included in the distributed package.
