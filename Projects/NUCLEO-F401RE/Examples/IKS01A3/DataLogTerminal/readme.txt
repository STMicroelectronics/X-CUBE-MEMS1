@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use sensor expansion board to send sensor data from a Nucleo board 
using UART to a connected PC or Desktop and display it on generic applications like TeraTerm.

After connection has been established:
  - the user can view the data from various on-board environment sensors like Temperature, Humidity and Pressure
  - the user can also view data from various on-board inertial sensors as well like Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer

The sample application uses the following serial settings:
  - Baud Rate: 115200
  - Data Bits: 8
  - Parity: None
  - Stop Bits: 1

------------------------------------
WARNING: When starting the project from Example Selector in STM32CubeMX and regenerating 
it from ioc file, you may face a build issue. To solve it, remove from the IDE project 
the file stm32f4xx_nucleo.c in Application/User virtual folder and delete from Src and 
Inc folders the files: stm32f4xx_nucleo.c, stm32f4xx_nucleo.h and stm32f4xx_nucleo_errno.h.

@par How to use it ? 

This package contains projects for 3 IDEs: IAR, Keil µVision and STM32CubeIDE. In order to make the 
program work, you must do the following:
  - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
    installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
    after building.
  - Open STM32CubeIDE or alternatively the Keil uVision toolchain or the IAR toolchain.
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
  - Run the example.
  - Alternatively, you can download the pre-built binaries in "Binary" 
    folder included in the distributed package.
