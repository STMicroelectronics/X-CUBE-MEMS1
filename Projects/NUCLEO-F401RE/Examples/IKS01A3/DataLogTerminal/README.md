## <b>DataLogTerminal Example Description</b>

This example shows how to use sensor expansion board to send sensor data from a Nucleo board using UART to a connected PC or Desktop and display it on generic applications like TeraTerm.
After connection has been established:

  - the user can view the data from various on-board environment sensors like Temperature, Humidity and Pressure
  - the user can also view data from various on-board inertial sensors as well like Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer

The sample application uses the following serial settings:

  - Baud Rate: 115200
  - Data Bits: 8
  - Parity: None
  - Stop Bits: 1

### <b>How to use it?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

  - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors after building
  - Open your preferred toolchain
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the FW application
  - Alternatively, you can download the pre-built binary in "Binary" folder included in the distributed package
