## <b>ApproachLeave_STHS34PF80 Application Description</b>

This application shows how to use [InfraredAL - Approach Leave](https://www.st.com) library to obtain object presence and its confidence using STHS34PF80 infrared temperature TMOS sensor only.
Data are sent from a Nucleo board using UART to a connected PC or Desktop.
To run the application, it is needed to install and launch the [MEMS Studio](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/mems-studio.html) on the PC.
After connection has been established:

  - the user can view Object Temperature [LSB] data from STHS34PF80 infrared temperature TMOS sensor
  - the user can view Object Presence or Absence and its confidence
  - the user can store the data in csv file

### <b>How to use it?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

  - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors after building
  - Open your preferred toolchain
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the FW application
  - Alternatively, you can download the pre-built binary in "Binary" folder included in the distributed package
