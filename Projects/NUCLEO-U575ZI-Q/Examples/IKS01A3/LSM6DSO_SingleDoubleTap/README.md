## <b>LSM6DSO_SingleDoubleTap Example Description</b>

This example shows how to detect the single and double tap events using the sensor expansion board and a STM32 Nucleo board.
After application is started:

  - the user can try to tap the STM32 Nucleo board; when the single tap is detected, the LED is switched on for a while
  - the user can push the button to pass from the single tap detection to the double tap detection feature; when the double tap is detected, the LED is switched on twice for a while
  - the user can push the button again to disable the single/double tap detection feature
  - the user can push the button again to enable the single tap detection feature and so on

### <b>How to use it?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

  - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors after building
  - Open your preferred toolchain
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the FW application
  - Alternatively, you can download the pre-built binary in "Binary" folder included in the distributed package
