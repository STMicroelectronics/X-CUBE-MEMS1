## <b>AirQuality_SGP40 Application Description</b>

This application shows how to use SGP40 gas sensor for Air Quality measurements.
Data are sent from a Nucleo board using UART to a connected PC or Desktop.
To run the application, it is needed to install and launch the [Unicleo-GUI](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/sensor-software-development-tools/unicleo-gui.html) on the PC.
After connection has been established:

  - the user can view data from SGP40 gas sensor
  - the user can perform the Air Quality measurements
  - the user can view Air Quality Index
  - the user can store the data in csv file
  - the user can load the offline data from csv file

### <b>How to use it?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

  - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors after building
  - Open your preferred toolchain
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the FW application
  - Alternatively, you can download the pre-built binary in "Binary" folder included in the distributed package
