@par Example Description

Main function is to show how to use Dynamic Inclinometer library to estimate
current inclination by using accelerometer and gyroscope sensor.

To run the application, it is needed to install and launch the Unicleo-GUI on the PC.
The Unicleo-GUI is available on https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/sensor-software-development-tools/unicleo-gui.html

------------------------------------
WARNING: When starting the project from Example Selector in STM32CubeMX and regenerating 
it from ioc file, you may face a build issue. To solve it, remove from the IDE project 
the file stm32l4xx_nucleo.c in Application/User virtual folder and delete from Src and 
Inc folders the files: stm32l4xx_nucleo.c, stm32l4xx_nucleo.h and stm32l4xx_nucleo_errno.h.

@par How to use it ? 

This package contains projects for 3 IDEs: IAR, Keil µVision and STM32CubeIDE. In order to make the 
program work, you must do the following:
  - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
    installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
    after building.
  - Open STM32CubeIDE or alternatively the Keil uVision toolchain or the IAR toolchain.
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
  - Run the example.
  - Alternatively, you can download the pre-built binaries in "Binary" 
    folder included in the distributed package.
